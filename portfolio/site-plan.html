      <h4> Introduction </h4>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Daniel, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho, with a strong focus on developing practical skills in programming and software design. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase some of the projects I’ve been working on, share a bit about my experience in tech, and just provide some foundational information about my personal life. <br>
        I’m passionate about problem-solving and I work to continuously enhance my technical abilities. With experience in languages like Python, C#, and C++, I’m building a solid foundation that I’m eager to expand upon. Each project represents a new challenge and an opportunity to learn, and I’m committed to producing quality work that’s both efficient and effective. <br>
        This site is designed to give you a glimpse into my background, my projects, and my goals as an aspiring software engineer. I invite you to explore and reach out if you’d like to connect or learn more!

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some of what I consider to be my most impressive coding projects, If you have any questions about any of them, feel free to reach out!<br>
1.	Message Decoder/Encoder<br>
a.	This is a project that I created as part of a job application. It is a web scraper designed to decode a message from a table of values, where the table has shuffled rows with 3 columns each, an X coordinate, a Y coordinate, and a unicode character. The decoder reads through the list, and prints out a complete grid, with every character in its correct spot according to the given coordinates. If the given input was valid, the final grid should spell out a word! I enjoyed this project so much that I reverse engineered an encoder to create these tables of values myself, just for fun.<br>
2.	CSE 210 Goal Program<br>
a.	This was the final project for CSE210, a class I took last semester. It is written in C#. The program is a “goal manager” which allows the user to gamify their goals by keeping track of a cumulative number of points. The user can set a number of points to be awarded for every chosen goal, and will be awarded those points when the goal is marked as completed. <br>
3.	Godot RPG<br>
a.	This is a personal project that has been a WIP for a few months. It was my first foray into game development. It’s a simple 2d RPG developed in the GODOT game engine. As it was my first attempt at game dev, this was almost entirely created by following a youtube tutorial (link here). <br>

      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>
        For brevity’s sake, this resume will include the 3 most recent jobs I’ve worked at time of writing. This isn’t meant to be a complete job history (I have other resources for that), rather a quick glance at the latest positions I’ve worked. <br>
1.	AI Trainer at Data Annotation. This is a remote position that I recently acquired. It’s a rather unique job. It is mainly composed of contract work that revolves around generating quality data to train LLMs. I’ve done a variety of work here, from writing simple python programs to short creative writing pieces. I’m excited to see where this position can take me. <br>
2.	Gas Station Manager at Apache Sands. This is a position I currently work. We have a full service gas station, meaning I’m in charge of managing not only your traditional gas pumps, but I also fill propane tanks and maintain our self-service car wash. It’s a lot of work, but it’s simple, and I’ve enjoyed my time here. <br>
3.	U-Haul Neighborhood Dealer at Apache Sands. I worked this position up until Apache Sands decided to close their u-haul operations, at which point I took over as their Gas Station manager as listed above. As a neighborhood dealer, I was the sole employee responsible for scheduling U-Haul moving truck reservations, dispatching rentals, retailing sales, and maintaining 40+ trucks and trailers. It was a very intense job, but I enjoyed the challenge.<br>
