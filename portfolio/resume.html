                <p>For brevity’s sake, this resume will include the 3 most recent jobs I’ve worked at time of writing. <br> This isn’t meant to be a complete job history (I have other resources for that), <br>rather, this is a quick glance at the latest positions I’ve worked.</p>

                <h2>AI Trainer at Data Annotation</h2>
                <p>This is a remote position that I recently acquired. It’s a rather unique job. It is mainly composed of contract work that revolves around generating quality data to train LLMs. I’ve done a variety of work here, from writing simple python programs to short creative writing pieces. I’m excited to see where this position can take me.</p>

                <h2>Gas Station Manager at Apache Sands Service Station</h2>
                <p>This is a position I currently work. We have a full service gas station, meaning I’m in charge of managing not only your traditional gas pumps, but I also fill propane tanks and maintain our self-service car wash. It’s a lot of work, but it’s simple, and I’ve enjoyed my time here. </p>

                <h2>U-Haul Neighborhood Dealer at Apache Sands</h2>
                <p>I worked this position up until Apache Sands decided to close down their U-Haul operations, at which point I took over as their gas station manager as listed above. As a neighborhood dealer, I was the sole employee responsible for scheduling U-Haul moving truck reservations, dispatching rentals, retailing sales, and maintaining 40+ trucks and trailers. It was a very intense job, but I enjoyed the challenge.</p>
